Discussion Forum

A `Google group`_ is available for discussing the book's materials and
related programming topics not necessarily limited to C and
Python. You can post your questions and doubts here. The questions
will be answered either by me or other readers like you.

You may also suggest any topic which you want me to cover in a future
article on this website.

Resources
=========

Although there is no shortage of tutorials and documentation on
programming in C and Python on the web, here are two resources which
you should always know of:

- `The GNU C Library Manual
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/>`_
- `Python documentation <http://docs.python.org/2.7/>`_
